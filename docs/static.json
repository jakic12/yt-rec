Truth is, I had just moved away from my friends and family and I started to feel very home sick and lonely like I didn’t belong in my new settings. Everything was just happening so fast and I couldn’t really grasp where I was or who I was but all i knew was that I felt Alone. With the music video, we really wanted to send a message. Nobody knows how you feel, whether you’re homesick, away from friends and family, or if you simply aren’t like everyone else…its ok. The whole purpose of the Marshmello project and the Mellogang is to bring together people from every corner of the world and create a family…a family that we can all count on to never let us feel Alone. I hope you guys enjoy this video as much as I do. It gives me the feels for sure.\n\nSUBSCRIBE HERE for more of the best music ▶ http://youtube.com/marshmellomusic?sub_confirmation=1\n\nPLAY MARSHMELLO MUSIC DANCE HERE ▶ http://smarturl.it/mellomusicdance\n\nFollow Marshmello's 'Keep It Mello' Spotify Playlist ▶ https://spoti.fi/2OuMHG0\n\nWatch Gaming with Marshmello HERE ▶ http://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcYK4PlHbZQvk3_Q6fbJy0xklOZ2aH7WP\n\nWatch Cooking with Marshmello HERE ▶ http://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcYK4PlHbZQtXROf5fnrr4dO4ruWiv7ts\n\nWATCH ONE THING RIGHT ▶ https://youtu.be/O6RyKbcpBfw\nWATCH LIGHT IT UP MUSIC VIDEO ▶ https://youtu.be/qGh2e-yqEYQ\nWATCH HERE WITH ME MUSIC VIDEO ▶ https://youtu.be/J3UXp9jIr-U\nWATCH BIBA MUSIC VIDEO ▶ https://youtu.be/UhYRlI_bpJQ\nWATCH PROJECT DREAMS MUSIC VIDEO ▶ https://youtu.be/Hn7WDtF3nKA\nWATCH HAPPIER MUSIC VIDEO ▶ https://youtu.be/m7Bc3pLyij0\nWATCH TOGETHER MUSIC VIDEO ▶ https://youtu.be/JePnQ1gSagc\nWATCH BAYEN HABEIT LYRIC VIDEO ▶ https://youtu.be/jNJCdxMf0t8\nWATCH STARS MUSIC VIDEO ▶ https://youtu.be/A57B7B6w3kw\nWATCH FLASHBACKS MUSIC VIDEO ▶ https://youtu.be/Lj-_mD0w474\nWATCH YOU CAN CRY MUSIC VIDEO ▶ https://youtu.be/2SJ0hgdciNE\nWATCH EVERYDAY MUSIC VIDEO ▶ https://youtu.be/bEdcJY8Emm8\nWATCH FLY MUSIC VIDEO ▶ https://youtu.be/oRArmtMA9AI\nWATCH FRIENDS MUSIC VIDEO ▶ https://youtu.be/jzD_yyEcp0M\nWATCH SPOTLIGHT MUSIC VIDEO ▶ https://youtu.be/7R1N-8SoqcM\nWATCH LOVE U MUSIC VIDEO ▶ https://youtu.be/D-pKeb6Wf4U\nWATCH TAKE IT BACK MUSIC VIDEO ▶ https://youtu.be/P9Ijqa_2eu0\nWATCH SILENCE MUSIC VIDEO ▶ https://youtu.be/Tx1sqYc3qas\nWATCH BLOCKS MUSIC VIDEO ▶ https://youtu.be/5E4ZBSInqUU\nWATCH YOU & ME MUSIC VIDEO ▶ https://youtu.be/fiusxyygqGk\nWATCH FIND ME MUSIC VIDEO ▶ https://youtu.be/ymq1WdGUcw8\nWATCH MOVING ON MUSIC VIDEO ▶ https://youtu.be/yU0tnrEk8H4\nWATCH SUMMER MUSIC VIDEO ▶ https://youtu.be/2vMH8lITTCE\nWATCH KEEP IT MELLO MUSIC VIDEO ▶ https://youtu.be/_J_VpmXAzqg\nWATCH RESCUE ME ▶ https://youtu.be/O6RyKbcpBfw \n\nMARSHMELLO: \nMerch | http://mellogang.com\nSpotify | http://spoti.fi/marshmello\nApple Music | https://apple.co/2n8Evz6\nSoundCloud | http://soundcloud.com/marshmellomusic\nInstagram | http://instagram.com/marshmellomusic\nFacebook | http://facebook.com/marshmellomusic\nTwitter | http://twitter.com/marshmellomusic\nTwitch | http://twitch.tv/marshmellomusic\n\nDirector: Daniel Burke\nCreative Agency: 23FIFTN\nCreative Director: Daniel Malikyar, Karam Gill\nExecutive Producer: Reed Matthews\nProducer: Karam Gill & Jack Winter\nDirector of Photography: Ian Quill\n1st AD: Helena McGill\nUnit Production Manager: Steven Taylor\nProduction Coordinator: Jake Herman & Cole Mier\nProduction Designer: Bryce Neville\nEditor/DIT: Alex Crosby\nColorist: Kinan Chabani\n\n#Marshmello #Alone #Mellogang #Popular #Trending","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ALZHF5UqnU4/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ALZHF5UqnU4/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ALZHF5UqnU4/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360}},"channelTitle":"Marshmello","liveBroadcastContent":"none"},{"id":"HpqEzMni4u4","publishedAt":"2016-05-08T07:43:17.000Z","channelId":"UCo6_eGNISy_OrgIQIZgMG7w","title":"Panda lyrics Desiigner","description":"I do not own the song","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HpqEzMni4u4/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HpqEzMni4u4/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HpqEzMni4u4/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360}},"channelTitle":"LyricsBoulevard","liveBroadcastContent":"none"},{"id":"hRXv_VU35Lw","publishedAt":"2019-04-19T04:03:16.000Z","channelId":"UC9PEibgWOqZ-1I1JdxRmr6g","title":"Old Town Road - Walk off the Earth (Lil Nas X, Billy Ray Cyrus Cover)","description":"See us live!

THE FOUR begins where most competitions end: with the four finalists. Four super-talented and fiercely competitive singers, chosen from their auditions by the show’s panel of music industry experts, will try to defend their coveted spots on the stage, as they are challenged individually by new singers determined to replace them. Each week, if any of the four are outperformed, they’ll go home and their challengers will take their place.\n\nABOUT TALENT RECAP \nTalent Recap is the #1 independent website which is exclusively dedicated to the fans of the most popular talent shows around the world.

This City Lyrics\n\nI've been seeing lonely people in crowded rooms\nCovering their old heartbreaks with new tattoos\nIt's all about smoke screens and cigarettes\nLooking through low lights at silhouettes\nBut all I see is lonely people in crowded rooms\nThis city is gonna break my heart\nThis city is gonna love me then leave me alone\nThis city's got me chasin' stars\nIt's been a couple months since I felt like I'm home\nAm I getting closer to knowing where I belong?\nThis city is gonna break my heart\nShe's always gonna break your heart\nI remember mornings where my head didn't hurt\nAnd I remember nights when art didn't feel like work\nShe wakes up at noon and she's up 'til three\nShe leaves her perfume all over me\nBut I remember mornings where my head didn't hurt\nOh, this city is gonna break my heart (it's gonna break my heart)\nThis city is gonna love me then leave me alone\nThis city's got me chasin' stars (it's got me chasin' stars)\nIt's been a couple months since I felt like I'm home\nAm I getting closer to knowing where I belong?\nThis city's gonna break my heart\nShe's always gonna break your heart\nShe got a hold on me\nShe got me wrapped 'round her finger\nShe got a hold on me\nShe got me wrapped 'round her finger\nThis city is gonna break my heart\nThis city is gonna love me then leave me alone (it's gonna love me then leave me alone)\nThis city's got me chasin stars\nIt's been a couple months since I felt like I'm home\nAm I getting closer to knowing where I belong?\nThis city is gonna break my heart\nShe's always gonna break your heart\nThis city is gonna break my heart\nShe's always gonna break your heart","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1oFZJ40XbVM/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1oFZJ40XbVM/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1oFZJ40XbVM/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360}},"channelTitle":"Gold Coast Music","liveBroadcastContent":"none"},{"id":"jgciuWEwYRI","publishedAt":"2018-12-20T16:50:27.000Z","channelId":"UC0aXGG4J16PmxgZo10Nzk6A","title":"Sam Smith -

I decided for that song because my parents like it very much and so I wanted to share this with you, as well. I have to admit that I like it very much too :D\n\nLike it and post a comment with feedback for me because I'm still  a \"newcomer\" in the area of lyrics-videos and I would appreciate some good feedback :) Hope you like the song as much as me (and many other of course) :)\n\nThe graphics might be a little bad for somebody's taste (and not HD) but I think they are good enough for a video of that kind and it's the best quality I can guarantee for ;)\n\nSong: Holding out for a hero\n\nArtist: Bonnie Tyler\n\nI do not own the rights of this song!\n\nI get my data on an absolutely legal basis!\n\nThank you very much.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3GPZDX9_2oE/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3GPZDX9_2oE/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3GPZDX9_2oE/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360}},"channelTitle":"1929GY","liveBroadcastContent":"none"},{"id":"pa2j0Bh83ms","publishedAt":"2018-07-26T20:07:33.000Z","channelId":"UCuubAXN9AYgtcmSrD0frggQ","title":"Gimme!

Nina Simone /ˈniːnə sɨˈmoʊn/ (born Eunice Kathleen Waymon; February 21, 1933 – April 21, 2003) was an American singer, songwriter, pianist, arranger, and civil rights activist widely associated with jazz music. She worked in a broad range of styles including classical, jazz, blues, folk, R&B, gospel, and pop.\n\nThe sixth child of a preacher's family in North Carolina, Simone aspired to be a concert pianist.[1] Her musical path changed direction after she was denied a scholarship to the prestigious Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, despite a well-received audition. Simone said she later found out from an insider at Curtis that she was denied entry because she was black.[2] So as to fund her continuing musical education and become a classical pianist, she began playing in a small club in Philadelphia where she was also required to sing. She was approached for a recording by Bethlehem Records, and her rendering of \"I Loves You, Porgy\" was a hit in the United States in 1958.[1] Over the length of her career Simone recorded more than 40 albums, mostly between 1958, when she made her debut with Little Girl Blue, and 1974.\n\nHer musical style arose from a fusion of gospel and pop songs with classical music, in particular with influences from her first inspiration, Johann Sebastian Bach,[3] and accompanied with her expressive jazz-like singing in her characteristic contralto voice. She injected as much of her classical background into her music as possible to give it more depth and quality, as she felt that pop music was inferior to classical.[4] Her intuitive grasp on the audience–performer relationship was gained from a unique background of playing piano accompaniment for church revivals and sermons regularly from the early age of six years old.[5]","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3ZS7iKdRo5Q/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3ZS7iKdRo5Q/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3ZS7iKdRo5Q/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360}},"channelTitle":"mavedro","liveBroadcastContent":"none"},{"id":"f4tTzan4dk4","publishedAt":"2012-03-17T08:16:01.000Z","channelId":"UCkzUtbU15lA7R4miFUtTq5g","title":"Seal - Stand By Me","description":"","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/f4tTzan4dk4/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/f4tTzan4dk4/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/f4tTzan4dk4/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360}},"channelTitle":"DarkyPhilou","liveBroadcastContent":"none"},{"id":"ABfQuZqq8wg","publishedAt":"2018-09-04T16:35:16.000Z","channelId":"UCpMMYJB5GJAYSJr3QpxnHEg","title":"Ain't No Mountain High Enough","description":"Provided to YouTube by Universal Music Group\n\nAin't No Mountain High Enough · Marvin Gaye · Tammi Terrell\n\nThe Complete Duets\n\n℗ 1967 Motown Records, a Division of UMG Recordings, Inc.\n\nReleased on: 2001-11-20\n\nComposer  Lyricist: Valerie Simpson\nComposer  Lyricist: Nickolas Ashford\n\nAuto-generated by YouTube.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ABfQuZqq8wg/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ABfQuZqq8wg/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ABfQuZqq8wg/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360}},"channelTitle":"Marvin Gaye - Topic","liveBroadcastContent":"none"},{"id":"HqYnevHibaI","publishedAt":"2011-04-05T23:34:23.000Z","channelId":"UC7TDZrm6vmMJ-Y1O-6n2E8g","title":"Aretha Franklin - Think (The Blues Brothers Version)","description":"The Queen of Soul performing Think.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HqYnevHibaI/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HqYnevHibaI/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HqYnevHibaI/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360}},"channelTitle":"davdavdee","liveBroadcastContent":"none"},{"id":"XKRI8CcpC9M","publishedAt":"2012-05-12T21:59:49.000Z","channelId":"UCgobRZZP4xdf0Q3NrY3GcIA","title":"Whitney Houston - performing  \"I Will Always Love You\" (HD) com legenda.","description":"\" Tenha o senhor Jesus Cristo como seu maior guarda-costas a partir de agora e encante aos anjos com sua voz ....eles também merecem ouvi-la\" .\r\nDescanse em Paz .\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\"Be the Lord Jesus Christ as his greatest bodyguards from now on and charm the angels with his voice .... they deserve to hear it.\"\r\n Rest in Peace.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XKRI8CcpC9M/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XKRI8CcpC9M/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XKRI8CcpC9M/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360}},"channelTitle":"GALANTE - JOC","liveBroadcastContent":"none"},{"id":"w3LZQLkGsSY","publishedAt":"2010-12-09T11:21:45.000Z","channelId":"UC_PytnuZXmV2RpQkKDw8hlQ","title":"Can't take my eyes off you (subtitulada)","description":"Versión del tema interpretada por el cantante de A-Ha.

Se fundó en la ciudad de su mismo nombre, en 1967, aunque inicialmente se denominó \"Chicago Transit Authority\", nombre que debieron recortar por problemas jurídicos con la autoridad de transporte público de la ciudad. El grupo permanece activo en la actualidad.La banda estuvo integrada, inicialmente, por Lee Loughnane (trompeta), James Pankow (trombón), Walter Parazaider (saxos, flauta), Robert Lamm (voz, piano, órgano), Terry Kath (guitarra, voz), Peter Cetera (bajo, voz) y Danny Seraphine (batería, percusión). Al contrario que BS&T, Chicago mantuvo esta formación bastante estable, a lo largo de su historia. El grupo se formó en el invierno de 1967, a partir del núcleo de la banda de Kath, Parazaider y Seraphine, que se llamaba \"The Missing Links\", durante una jam session en la Universidad DePaul, cuando se les unieron en el escenario Pankow y Loughnane. El nuevo grupo se llamó \"The Big Thing\",y se completó poco después con Cetera y Lam. Fue éste quien embarcó a la banda en una gira a Los Ángeles, donde, ya bajo el nombre de Chicago Transit Authority, cosecharon un inesperado éxito.\n\nEse mismo año, el productor James William Guercio, decidió tutelarlos y, por ello, renunció a producir el primer disco de BS&T, tal como le había pedido Al Kooper. Sí produjo, sin embargo, el segundo, aunque sólo después de que CBS le hubiese dado luz verde a la grabación del primer álbum de \"sus chicos\".GENEROS: Rock,Soft rock,Jazz rock,Jazz fusion,Pop rock,Rock progresivo.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/x90oqr7k9g0/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/x90oqr7k9g0/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/x90oqr7k9g0/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360}},"channelTitle":"Mily Diamante","liveBroadcastContent":"none"},{"id":"__VQX2Xn7tI","publishedAt":"2006-06-05T12:36:37.000Z","channelId":"UCN9Y_N7yRxFf6OSF9_KUzgQ","title":"carpenters -We've Only Just Begun","description":"MTV","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/__VQX2Xn7tI/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/__VQX2Xn7tI/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/__VQX2Xn7tI/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360}},"channelTitle":"ryanche33","liveBroadcastContent":"none"},{"id":"PSoOFn3wQV4","publishedAt":"2013-01-25T00:36:15.000Z","channelId":"UCzIOJfQMRe_-TlUOeVMqzzQ","title":"The Bangles - Eternal Flame (Official Video)","description":"Official Music Video for “Eternal Flame” by The Bangles\nListen to The Bangles: https://TheBangles.lnk.to/essentialYD\n\n'Eternal Flame' comes off The Bangles' third album, \"Everything\", released in 1988.

I had just read a book about Janis which is why I added the comments between the pictures. I could relate so much to her inner demons and struggles at that time which is why I put my focus on that instead of the good things she achieved and how she changed the world. That's also unfortunate but that's how it is.\nThere are many more videos out there that contains more information if you want to read about Janis. I just made this video for fun, bored at work.

The music score was by Burt Bacharach with song lyrics by Hal David. Along with Newman and Redford, the film stars Katharine Ross as Etta Place, and features Strother Martin, Henry Jones, Jeff Corey, Sam Elliott, Cloris Leachman, Ted Cassidy, Kenneth Mars, and Donnelly Rhodes.\r\n\r\nButch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969) is the likeably entertaining, charming and amusing comedy/drama of the friendship and camaraderie shared between the two handsome and humorous buddy leads - legendary, turn-of-the-century Western outlaws and their \"Hole in the Wall\" gang.

The tune was a crossover smash and hit #6 on the Billboard R&B Chart and #2 on the Billboard AC Chart. The tune was also a Top 10 hit in Australia, Belgium, Canada and  South Africa. Written by Burt Bacharach and Hal David, the tune was presented to Dionne in unfinished form while she, Hal and Burt were rehearsing in Burt's Manhattan apartment for a recording session a few days hence at Bell Sound. Bacharach had finished the score but Hal had written only about a third of the lyric and was struggling with what Hal regarded a bad accent in the sixth line of the first stanza, which he could not resolve. Burt played a snippet of the tune for Dionne, and she fell in love with the tune and begged Hal to finish it. Hal, according to his wonderful 1968 book \"What the World Needs Now and Other Love Lyrics\", went to Burt's bedroom while Burt and Dionne rehearsed in the living room and finished the lyric. The tune was recorded at Bell Sound Studios in Manhattan in November 1963, days after the assassination of JFK, in the same session as Bacharach and David's \"Walk On By\" and \"In the Land of Make Believe\". Rumor has it Warwick nailed the tune in only one take. Cilla Black, a top female recording artist in the Uk but little known outside the UK recorded a cover version released in the UK in January 1964 before Scepter licensee Pye records could release Warwick's original and Black's cover became her first number one hit in the UK. Dionne's original version, released two weeks after Cilla's in the UK did make the UK charts at  #43. However, in the USA, Black's cover died at Billboard #91. Black remained relatively unknown except to fans in the UK while Warwick went on to achieve worldwide stardom. Anyone Who Had A Heart was Dionne's first international million-seller. Linda Ronstadt covered the tune in 1994 as a tribute to Warwick for the album \"Winter Light.\" Dusty Springfield cut a cover of the tune in 1964 and both Shelby Lynne and Atomic Kitten remakes were released in 2008.\r\nWrites Nick Tosches, the renowned writer, music journalist, novelist, biographer and poet in the January 7, 1972 issue of the rock magazine FUSION; \".getting into Dionne Warwick is like finding buried treasure. The Bacharach/David repertoire which milady chooses to sing is so fascinatingly cynical / fatalistic / stoical / emotional / happy, simultaneously! It's pure emotion. There is a whole lot more to emotion than some rock punk bursting his dexedrine-staved blood vessels by screaming \"Baby I need you baby\" into a microphone. Dionne Warwick is not a rock and roll singer. She's not a jazz singer either. Rhythm and blues? Nope. A pop singer? No way. Did you ever tongue-kiss with someone who barfed a Singapore Sling bolus into your mouth, and then four years later you're with someone else and you feel good and you realize how beautiful it all was and then it's all melancholy/happiness, sort of? That's the kind of singer Dionne Warwick is. She's beautiful. Dionne, paired with Bacharach's string/horn/reed arrangements, comes up as a lyric mezzo-sopranoid par-excellence, melodious/expressiveness-wise. If you've never gotten into her, you ought to. Get hep to Dionne Warwick. For your own sake.\"","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qMsiGMKHJ8k/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qMsiGMKHJ8k/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qMsiGMKHJ8k/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360}},"channelTitle":"dibotis","liveBroadcastContent":"none"},{"id":"FscIgtDJFXg","publishedAt":"2012-06-13T19:16:40.000Z","channelId":"UCFV6IvMDMpcWZT3EjJOJgAw","title":"Johnny Nash - I Can See Clearly Now","description":"I Can See Clearly Now\" is a Billboard Hot 100 Chart #1 hit song, written and recorded by Johnny Nash.

En la portada del álbum aparece la modelo Dolores Erickson cubierta de crema de afeitar y no de crema batida como sugiere el título, pues se derrite rápidamente y no se presta para la fotografía. La modelo tenía tres meses de embarazo cuando se tomó la foto. \n\nEl tema \"Whipped cream\" fue incluido como pista en la película animada de DreamWorks, Shrek. Fue compuesto por Allen Toussaint. En los créditos de la canción aparece bajo el seudónimo de Naomi Neville.\n\nAllen Toussaint nació el 14 de enero de 1938 en Gert Town, Louisiana. Es un compositor, músico y productor estadounidense. Es una leyenda del rhythm and blues de Nueva Orleans. Un buen número de canciones de Allen Toussaint han saltado a la fama gracias a versiones grabadas por otros músicos. Destacan temas tales como \"Ride your pony\", \"Fortune teller\", \"Southern lights\", \"Working in the coalmine\", y otros. En los años sesentas firmó varios temas bajo el seudónimo de Naomi Neville (el nombre de soltera de su madre). En los años setenta, produjo el aclamado álbum \"Nightbirds\" de Patty Labelle, de 1975, de donde salió el éxito \"Lady Marmalade\". Ese mismo año colaboró en el álbum \"Venus and Mars\" de Paul McCartney & The Wings. Se le conoce también por ser el compositor de la melodía \"Java\", grabado instrumentalmente por el trompetista norteamericano Al Hirt en 1963.\n\nHerbert \"Herb\" Alpert nació en Los Ángeles, California, EEUU, el 31 de marzo de 1935. Es un trompetista y cantante estadounidense conocido por formar parte del grupo Herb Alpert & The Tijuana Brass, Herb Alpert's Tijuana Brass o simplemente TJB. También es famoso por ser un ejecutivo de la industria fonográfica -es la letra \"A\" de A&M Records, un sello de grabación fundado junto a Jerry Moss-. Los logros musicales de Alpert incluyen cinco números uno, veintiocho álbumes en las listas de Billboard, ocho Premios Grammy, catorce discos de platino y quince discos de oro.  En los años setenta, Herb Alpert inició una carrera en solitario, haciendo - sin embargo - esporádicas grabaciones con la Tijuana Brass.  En 1979 publicó 'Rise', uno de sus temas más exitosos, ganando un Premio Grammy.  Ese mismo año también triunfó con su tema \"Rotation\". En 1982, en su álbum \"Fandango\" obtuvo un éxito resonante con la melodía \"Route 101\".  El trompetista angelino ha trabajado como productor teatral de Broadway, destacando por su producción de \"Angels in America\" de Tony Kushner, la cual obtuvo un Premio Tony. Alpert continúa tocando la trompeta y a la vez dedica tiempo a su segunda carrera como escultor y pintor expresionista abstracto, exhibiendo sus obras alrededor de los Estados Unidos y Europa.

Among friends and fellow musicians he preferred being called \"Brother Ray\". He was often referred to as \"The Genius\". Charles was blind from the age of seven.\nHe pioneered the genre of soul music during the 1950s by combining blues, rhythm and blues, and gospel styles into the music he recorded for Atlantic Records. He also contributed to the integration of country and rhythm and blues and pop music during the 1960s with his crossover success on ABC Records, most notably with his two Modern Sounds albums. While he was with ABC, Charles became one of the first African-American musicians to be granted artistic control by a mainstream record company.\nCharles cited Nat King Cole as a primary influence, but his music was also influenced by country, jazz, blues, and rhythm and blues artists of the day, including Louis Jordan and Charles Brown. In the late forties he became friends with Quincy Jones, to whom he learned the ropes of arranging jazz music. Their friendship would last till the end.\nFrank Sinatra called him \"the only true genius in show business\", although Charles downplayed this notion.\nIn 2004, Rolling Stone ranked Charles at number ten on their list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\", and number two on their November 2008 list of the \"100 Greatest Singers of All Time\". Billy Joel observed: \"This may sound like sacrilege, but I think Ray Charles was more important than Elvis Presley\".\nFROM WIKIPEDIA: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Charles 🎷🎶 🎷🎶 🎷🎶 \n\nSubscribe to our channel for the best music masterpieces: http://bit.ly/ClassicMoodExperience\n\nClassic Mood Experience The best masterpieces ever recorded in the music history.\n\nExplore Classic Mood Experience music, the best  jazz, blues, rock, pop, R&B, soul, lantin songs ever recorded by Etta James, Billie Holiday, Bill Evans, Stevie Wonder, Ray Charles, Nina Simone, Muddy Waters, Django Reinhardt, Louis Armstrong, Miles Davis, James Brown, Chet Baker, Frank Sinatra, Ella Fitzgerald, Harry Belafonte, Nat King Cole, Louis Prima, Duke Ellington, Elvis Presley, Count Basie, Little Walter, Herbie Hancock, Edith Piaf, Aretha Franklin, Charlie Parker, Lightnin' Hopkins, Son House, B.B.

During his career, Vandross sold over twenty-five million albums and won eight Grammy Awards including Best Male R&B Vocal Performance four times. He won four Grammy Awards in 2004 including the Grammy Award for Song of the Year for the track \"Dance with My Father\", co-written with Richard Marx.\nVandross suffered from diabetes and hypertension, both of which ran in his family.\nOn April 16, 2003, Vandross suffered a stroke at his home in New York City. At the time of his stroke, he had just finished the final vocals for the album Dance With My Father. His collaborator on the album was pop star Richard Marx, whom Vandross had met in 1989. Vandross appeared briefly on videotape at the 2004 Grammy Awards to accept his Song of the Year Award, where he said, \"When I say goodbye it's never for long because I believe in the power of love\". Other than an appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show, he was never seen in public again.\nVandross died on July 1, 2005 at John F. Kennedy Medical Center in Edison, New Jersey at the age of 54. The apparent cause of his death was a heart attack.\nAfter two days of viewing at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel, his funeral was held at Riverside Church in New York City on July 8, 2005. Vandross was interred at George Washington Memorial Park in Paramus, New Jersey. Much of his estate was left to friends and his godson Mark West.\nFor additional text, please refer to;\nLuther Vandross\nat Wkipedia, the free encyclopedia","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WQDLu0tRASI/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WQDLu0tRASI/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WQDLu0tRASI/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360}},"channelTitle":"BERTOsCAFEdeMANNILE","liveBroadcastContent":"none"},{"id":"QShq1KGbEOk","publishedAt":"2019-08-31T16:06:03.000Z","channelId":"UCeqZi_19IJ0bNaGVugG7u7A","title":"Gryffin & Slander - All You Need To Know ft.

Dion","description":"ฉันรู้สึกเห็นเธอด้วยทุกคืนฝัน  จึงรู้พลันเธอวนเวียนอยู่ใกล้ใกล้\nแม้ครรลองของสองเราช่างห่างไกล  สำแดงตนของเธอไซร้ให้รับรู้\nจะใกล้ไกลไม่ว่าเธออยู่แห่งไหน  ฉันเชื่อมั่นว่าหัวใจดำรงอยู่\nอีกครั้งที่เธอยอมเปิดประตู  เพื่อมาอยู่ในใจฉันนิรันดร์กาล\nอันความรักจักสัมผัสเราหนึ่งหน  แต่จักยงคงทนจนอวสาน\nมิปล่อยให้รักหลุดผันอันตรธาน  จนกว่าชีพบันดาลให้เป็นไป\nรักคือเมื่อฉันได้รักเธออย่างยิ่ง  ในช่วงจริงที่โอบอุ้มสัมผัสได้\nในวิถีชีวิตฉันฉันมั่นใจ  เราจักคงคู่ไปนิรันดร\nเธออยู่นี่จึงมิมีใดหวาดหวั่น  และใจฉันไปต่อได้ไม่ถอดถอน\nตลอดไปอยู่แบบนี้มิจากจร  เธอปลอดภัยถาวรในหัวใจ\n.............แล้วดวงหฤทัยจักครรไลล่วงทุกช่วงไป.\n\nMy Heart Will Go On เพลงประกอบภาพยนตร์เรื่อง Titanic ไททานิก ซึ่งออกฉายในปี 1997 ผลงานการเรียบเรียงดนตรีของ James Horner, คำร้องโดย Will Jennings ร้องโดย Celine Dion นักร้องสาวชาวแคนาเดียน ออกจำหน่ายครั้งแรกในปี 1997 เป็นเพลงอันดับ 1 ทั่วโลก รวมถึงสหรัฐอเมริกา, สหราชอาณาจักร, ออสเตรเลีย \" เป็น 1 ใน 50 เพลงรักยอดนิยมอันดับ 3 ในปี 2006 ได้รับเลือกให้ใช้เปิดในงานแต่งงานมากที่สุดอีกเพลงหนึ่ง รวมทั้งในเมืองไทยด้วย และยังคว้าอีกหลายรางวัล \n\nAcademy Award รางวัล Best Original Song ในปี 1997 \nได้รับการเสนอชื่อเข้าชิงรางวัล Grammy Awards ปี 1999 \nชนะเลิศ Record of the Year, Song of the Year, Best Female Pop Vocal Performance และ Best Song Written Specifically \nรางวัล Motion Picture หรือ Television \"My Heart Will Go On\" \nรางวัล Golden Globe Award ปี 1998 \n\nTitanic  หนังโรมานซ์ของสหรัฐอเมริกา สร้างมาจากเหตุการณ์จริงเมื่อไททานิก อับปางในปี 1912 ทั้งๆที่เรือโดยสารไอน้ำลำนี้ถูกออกแบบให้เป็นเรือสำราญ ที่คลาสสิกและล้ำสมัย และเป็นเรือที่ทุกคนรู้จักกันดีว่าลำใหญ่ที่สุดเท่าที่มนุษยชาติเคยสร้างขึ้นมา มีความหรูหราอย่างเหลือเชื่อ ประกอบกับความเร็วสูงทั้งแข็งแกร่งปลอดภัยและไม่มีวันจม ลำตัวเรือมีท้องเรือสองชั้นเพิ่อช่วยป้องกันเรือถ้าไปชนสิ่งกีดขวางใต้น้ำ และมีการแบ่งลำตัวเรือเป็นห้อง ๆ แบ่งด้านในของเรือเป็นส่วนย่อย ๆ เพื่อสกัดกั้นไม่ให้น้ำไหลท่วมไปทั่ว ทั้งสองสิ่งนี้รวมทั้งคุณสมบัติอื่น ๆในการออกแบบ ได้ทำให้ผู้โดยสารและลูกเรือมีความมั่นใจสูงในเรื่องของความปลอดภัย แต่แล้วเรือได้จมลงสู่ก้นมหาสมุทรแอตแลนติกเมื่อวันที่ 15 เมษายน ปี 1912 หลังชนภูเขาน้ำแข็งระหว่างการเดินทางเที่ยวแรกจากเซาท์แทมป์ตัน สหราชอาณาจักร ไปนครนิวยอร์ก สหรัฐอเมริกา การจมของไททานิกครั้งนี้ส่งผลให้มีผู้เสียชีวิต 1,514 ศพ นับเป็นภัยพิบัติทางทะเลในยามสงบครั้งที่มีผู้เสียชีวิตมากครั้งหนึ่งในประวัติศาสตร์\n\nเรื่องจริงที่น้อยคนนักจะรู้ว่าครอบครัวชาวอเมริกันพ่อ แม่ ลูกที่รอดชีวิตในครั้งนั้น ผู้เป็นลูก Alden Gates Caldwell เกิดวันที่ 10 มิถุนายน 1911 ที่กรุงเทพฯ หลังจากที่พ่อและแม่ของเขาเดินทางมาเป็นมิชชันนารี และเป็นครูสอนหนังสือที่โรงเรียนกรุงเทพคริสเตียนวิทยาลัย และ  “มิลวินา ดีน” ผู้รอดชีวิตคนสุดท้ายจากโศกนาฏกรรมเรือสำราญยักษ์ใหญ่ล่มครั้งนี้ได้เสียชีวิตลงแล้วที่บ้านพักคนชรา ในอังกฤษ เมื่อปี 1999 ด้วยอายุ 97 ปี\n\nไททานิก เป็นหนังที่ทำรายได้สูงสุด 1,800 ล้านเหรียญสหรัฐทั่วโลกอันดับที่ 1 นานถึง 12 ปี ด้วยมูลค่ามากถึง 1,848,813,795 ดอลลาร์สหรัฐทั่วโลก จนกระทั่งในปี ค.ศ. 2010 จึงถูกทำลายสถิติลงด้วยภาพยนตร์เรื่อง Avatar  \"อวตาร\" โดยฝีมือผู้กำกับคนเดียวกัน James Cameron\n\nหนังเรื่องนี้เองที่คนไทยเรียกกันติดปากว่า\" แจ๊คกับโรส\" ตำนานความรักของคู่หนุ่มสาวซึ่งเป็นชื่อของพระเอก Jack Dawson กับนางเอก Rose DeWitt Bukate และเป็นหนังดังในลาว ชื่อเรื่อง \"ชู้รักเรือล่ม\"\n\nEvery night in my dreams\nI see you, I feel you,\nThat is how I know you go on\n\nFar across the distance\nAnd spaces between us\nYou have come to show you go on\n\nNear, far, wherever you are\nI believe that the heart does go on\nOnce more you open the door\nAnd you're here in my heart\nAnd my heart will go on and on\n\nLove can touch us one time\nAnd last for a lifetime\nAnd never let go 'til we're gone\n\nLove was when I loved you\nOne true time I hold to\nIn my life we'll always go on\n\nNear, far, wherever you are\nI believe that the heart does go on\nOnce more you open the door\nAnd you're here in my heart\nAnd my heart will go on and on\n\nYou're here, there's nothing I fear,\nAnd I know that my heart will go on\nWe'll stay forever this way\nYou are safe in my heart\nAnd my heart will go on and

mind\r\nIf I never wake in the morning\r\nWould she ever doubt the way I feel\r\nAbout her in my heart?\r\n\r\nIf tomorrow never comes\r\nWill she know how much I loved her?\r\nDid I try in every way\r\nTo show her every day\r\nThat she's my only one?\r\nAnd if my time on Earth were through\r\nShe must face this world without me\r\nIs the love I gave her in the past\r\nGonna be enough to last\r\nIf tomorrow never comes?\r\n\r\n'Cause I've lost loved ones in my life\r\nWho never knew how much I loved them\r\nNow I live with the regret\r\nThat my true feelings for them\r\nNever were revealed\r\nSo I made a promise to myself\r\nTo say each day how much she means to me\r\nAnd avoid that circumstance\r\nWhere there's no second chance\r\nTo tell her how I feel\r\n\r\nIf tomorrow never comes\r\nWill she know how much I loved her?\r\nDid I try in every way\r\nTo show her every day\r\nThat she's my only one?\r\nAnd if my time on Earth were through\r\nShe must face this world without me\r\nIs the love I gave her in the past\r\nGonna be enough to last\r\nIf tomorrow never comes?\r\n\r\nTo tell that someone that you love\r\nJust what you're thinking of\r\nIf tomorrow never

She was noted for her purity of tone, impeccable diction, phrasing and intonation, and a \"horn-like\" improvisational ability, particularly in her scat singing.\nAfter tumultuous teenage years, Fitzgerald found stability in musical success with the Chick Webb Orchestra, performing across the country, but most often associated with the Savoy Ballroom in Harlem. Fitzgerald's rendition of the nursery rhyme \"A-Tisket, A-Tasket\" helped boost both her and Webb to national fame. Taking over the band after Webb died, Fitzgerald left it behind in 1942 to start a solo career that would last effectively the rest of her life.\nSigned with manager and Savoy co-founder Moe Gale from early in her career, she eventually gave managerial control for her performance and recording career to Norman Granz, who built up the label Verve Records based in part on Fitzgerald's vocal abilities. With Verve she recorded some of her more widely noted works, particularly her interpretation of the Great American Songbook.\nWhile Fitzgerald appeared in movies and as a guest on popular television shows in the second half of the twentieth century, her musical collaborations with Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, and The Ink Spots were some of her most notable acts outside of her solo career. These partnerships produced recognizable songs like \"Dream a Little Dream of Me\", \"Cheek to Cheek\", \"Into Each Life Some Rain Must Fall\", and \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)\". In 1993, Fitzgerald capped off her sixty-year career with her last public performance. Three years later, she died at the age of 79, following years of decline in her health. After her passing, Fitzgerald's influence lived on through her fourteen Grammy Awards, National Medal of Arts, Presidential Medal of Freedom, and tributes in the form of stamps, music festivals, and theater namesakes.\nFROM WIKIPEDIA: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ella_Fitzgerald\nLouis Armstrong (August 4, 1901 – July 6, 1971),[1] nicknamed Satchmo[2] or Pops, was an American trumpeter, composer, singer and occasional actor who was one of the most influential figures in jazz. His career spanned five decades, from the 1920s to the 1960s, and different eras in jazz.[3]\nComing to prominence in the 1920s as an \"inventive\" trumpet and cornet player, Armstrong was a foundational influence in jazz, shifting the focus of the music from collective improvisation to solo performance.[4] With his instantly recognizable gravelly voice, Armstrong was also an influential singer, demonstrating great dexterity as an improviser, bending the lyrics and melody of a song for expressive purposes. He was also skilled at scat singing.\nRenowned for his charismatic stage presence and voice almost as much as for his trumpet-playing, Armstrong's influence extends well beyond jazz music, and by the end of his career in the 1960s, he was widely regarded as a profound influence on popular music in general. Armstrong was one of the first truly popular African-American entertainers to \"cross over\", whose skin color was secondary to his music in an America that was extremely racially divided. He rarely publicly politicized his race, often to the dismay of fellow African-Americans, but took a well-publicized stand for desegregation in the Little Rock Crisis. His artistry and personality allowed him socially acceptable access to the upper echelons of American society which were highly restricted for black men of his era.\nFROM WIKIPEDIA: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Armstrong\nElla and Louis is a 1956 studio album by Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong, accompanied by the Oscar Peterson Quartet. Having previously collaborated in the late 1940s for the Decca label, this was the first of three albums that Fitzgerald and Armstrong were to record together for Verve Records, later followed by 1957's Ella and Louis Again and 1959's Porgy and Bess.\nFROM WIKIPEDIA: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ella_and_Louis","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VqOaQgD_2KA/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VqOaQgD_2KA/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VqOaQgD_2KA/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360}},"channelTitle":"Classic Mood Experience","liveBroadcastContent":"none"},{"id":"S39ccO6saQU","publishedAt":"2019-09-19T08:43:06.000Z","channelId":"UCqf3Dq0wiamvqrOEmRRDiNQ","title":"Romantic Love Songs 80's 90's Playlist - Greatest Love Songs 70's 80's 90's Collection Vol2","description":"🔔LOVE SONGS PLAYLIST : https://bitlylink.com/FNUwZ\n→ Follow Country House :\n©Youtube →https://bitlylink.com/0vUUA\n©Facebook→ https://goo.gl/Mmid1s\n©Instagram → https://www.instagram.com/mr.hosynham/\n©Thanks for watching!

Basada en un ostinato de mandolina, fue un éxito inesperado del grupo, debido a su amplia difusión a través de la radio y MTV por su video promocional, aclamado por la crítica. La canción fue el tema de R.E.M. en alcanzar la posición más alta en Estados Unidos, llegando al cuarto puesto en el Billboard Hot 100 y expandiendo la popularidad del grupo.

Just click on DISCUSSION to read the comments of other fans or maybe share your own thoughts with us ....\n\nAbout the song and video .....\n\nGilbert`s classic world-wide hit from 1972 . There are many videos of Gilbert performing this song - but none of them capture the spirit of the record . I thought it was time the song got the kind of video it deserves !  If you haven`t seen this footage before , it was filmed for promotional purposes when the single was released - but music videos weren`t commonly used back in 1972 !\nIt features Clair Mills herself - the daughter of his manager Gordon Mills for whom Gilbert used to baby-sit in the early days of their partnership . He wrote the song as a gift for her parents to say thanks for everything they had done for him .  It`s actually Gordon Mills playing the harmonica solo !  Hope you enjoy this video of Clair having fun with ` Uncle Ray ` - ( Raymond is Gilberts real name ! )\n\nLyrics to Clair :\n\nClair, the moment I met you, I swear\nI felt as if something, somewhere\nHad happened to me, which I couldn't see\nAnd then, the moment I met you, again\nI knew in my heart that we were friends\nIt had to be so, it couldn't be no\n\nBut try as hard as I might do, I don't know why\nYou get to me in a way I can't describe\nWords mean so little when you look up and smile\nI don't care what people say\nTo me you're more than a child\n\nOh, Clair\nClair\n\nClair, if ever a moment so rare\nWas captured for all to compare\nThat moment is you in all that you do\nBut why in spite of our age difference do I cry\nEach time I leave you I feel I could die\nNothing means more to me than hearing you say\n\"I'm going to marry you\nWill you marry me, Uncle Ray ? \"\n\nOh, Clair\nClair\n\nClair, I've told you before \"Don't you dare\"\n\"Get back into bed\"\n\"Can't you see that it's late\"\n\"No you can't have a drink\"\n\"Oh, alright then, but wait just a bit \"\n\nWhile I, in an effort to babysit, catch of my breath\nWhat there is left of it\nYou can be murder at this hour of the day\nBut in the morning this hour will seem a lifetime away\nOh Clair\nClair\nOh Clair","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sU9fClvdo5s/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sU9fClvdo5s/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sU9fClvdo5s/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360}},"channelTitle":"mohawk3881","liveBroadcastContent":"none"},{"id":"qdGGNFWGY98","publishedAt":"2013-06-08T22:27:42.000Z","channelId":"UC6_tPJXMxeOmIUQxkxkjixg","title":"Christopher Cross - Arthurs Theme subtitulada al español TOP RETRO","description":"Los mejores videos subtitulados de los 70 80 y 90.- TOP RETRO - CLASSIC ROCK MUSIC pronto en TV siguenos en facebook \"TOP RETRO\" haz click en me gusta.-","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qdGGNFWGY98/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qdGGNFWGY98/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qdGGNFWGY98/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360}},"channelTitle":"roberto roberts","liveBroadcastContent":"none"},{"id":"UG4zAK4aKGc","publishedAt":"2010-02-11T17:05:00.000Z","channelId":"UCgoi2Mzk6MbDChxXMnmSWvg","title":"Nazareth - Love hurts Lyrics ( TRADUCIDA AL ESPAÑOL )","description":"Love hurts LYRICS  SPANISH\r\n\r\nSong: Love hurts \r\n\r\nby Nazareth","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UG4zAK4aKGc/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UG4zAK4aKGc/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UG4zAK4aKGc/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360}},"channelTitle":"Ashley Miranda","liveBroadcastContent":"none"},{"id":"y8OtzJtp-EM","publishedAt":"2017-01-22T11:11:07.000Z","channelId":"UCYtap7ujIPaxTS2iCDoMi3g","title":"Immigrant Song (2007 Remaster)","description":"Provided to YouTube by Rhino Atlantic\n\nImmigrant Song (2007 Remaster) · Led Zeppelin\n\nMothership (Remastered)\n\n℗ 2007 Atlantic Recording Corporation for the United States and WEA International Inc. for the world outside of the United States.\n\nEngineer: Andy Johns\nGuitar, Producer: Jimmy Page\nDrums: John Bonham\nRemastering  Engineer: John Davis\nBass  Guitar: John Paul Jones\nVocals: Robert Plant\nWriter: Jimmy Page\nWriter: Robert Plant\n\nAuto-generated by YouTube.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/y8OtzJtp-EM/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/y8OtzJtp-EM/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/y8OtzJtp-EM/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360}},"channelTitle":"Led Zeppelin - Topic","liveBroadcastContent":"none"},{"id":"25ROFXjoaAU","publishedAt":"2019-09-03T18:24:28.000Z","channelId":"UCNqFDjYTexJDET3rPDrmJKg","title":"The Chainsmokers - Closer (Lyrics) ft.

Or are you wanting a full night’s rest with deep sleeping music? The choice is yours. \n\nSo, if you are struggling to go to sleep or if you are looking to fall asleep faster, try listening to Body Mind Zone’s relaxing sleep music. Let our deep sleep music, with delta waves and ambient instrumental music, help you reach a state of deep sleep relaxation so that you easily fall asleep.

Amigos, inscritos e simpatizantes do canal Orlando Dias Jr, infelizmente muitos vídeos do canal estão sendo excluídos e quem estar tomando essa decisão de excluir alguns vídeos do meu canal é a própria plataforma do youtube, acredito ser um tipo retalhação ao meu canal, por se tratar de não ser parceiro do youtube! Pois, não admito que o youtube   passe comerciais nos meus vídeos, para não perder a magia de voltar ao passado através da música. Não sou recompensado  monetariamente pelo o youtube e poderia ser! mas, não quero esse tipo de parceria com o youtube. Pois, sempre pensei em cada um de vocês! cada postagem que faço! presenteio todos os inscritos, visitantes e amigos!.. Tenho um grande acervo musical pois toda minha vida foi a música. Mas, estou pensando em parar diante desses acontecimentos!.. Tenho dado minha contribuição na memória da nossa Música Brasileira em divulgar meus acervos para o Brasil e o mundo. Já produzi mais de 2500 vídeos e tenho materiais para vinte vezes mais, muitas horas de dedicação e muita conta de internet e energia pagas sem contar vários equipamentos eletrônicos usados e investidos no canal. Só que agora, está tudo diferente! estou trabalhando dobrado para ter que repor os vídeos que a todo instante o youtube exclui. Se os amigos e amigas quiserem que eu continue fazendo esse trabalho, peço gentilmente a cada um de vocês me ajude financeiramente com a quantia mensal de (Um Real, 1.00) Agência:0944  013 CONTA: 00012260-7 Banco: Caixa Econômica Federal, para poder continuar esse trabalho, desde já agradeço a todos e lembrem-se o que  vem para fazermos, façamos com amor!
