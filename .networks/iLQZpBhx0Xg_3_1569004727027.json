Among friends and fellow musicians he preferred being called \"Brother Ray\". He was often referred to as \"The Genius\". Charles was blind from the age of seven.\nHe pioneered the genre of soul music during the 1950s by combining blues, rhythm and blues, and gospel styles into the music he recorded for Atlantic Records. He also contributed to the integration of country and rhythm and blues and pop music during the 1960s with his crossover success on ABC Records, most notably with his two Modern Sounds albums. While he was with ABC, Charles became one of the first African-American musicians to be granted artistic control by a mainstream record company.\nCharles cited Nat King Cole as a primary influence, but his music was also influenced by country, jazz, blues, and rhythm and blues artists of the day, including Louis Jordan and Charles Brown. In the late forties he became friends with Quincy Jones, to whom he learned the ropes of arranging jazz music. Their friendship would last till the end.\nFrank Sinatra called him \"the only true genius in show business\", although Charles downplayed this notion.\nIn 2004, Rolling Stone ranked Charles at number ten on their list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\", and number two on their November 2008 list of the \"100 Greatest Singers of All Time\". Billy Joel observed: \"This may sound like sacrilege, but I think Ray Charles was more important than Elvis Presley\".\nFROM WIKIPEDIA: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Charles 🎷🎶 🎷🎶 🎷🎶 \n\nSubscribe to our channel for the best music masterpieces: http://bit.ly/ClassicMoodExperience\n\nClassic Mood Experience The best masterpieces ever recorded in the music history.\n\nExplore Classic Mood Experience music, the best  jazz, blues, rock, pop, R&B, soul, lantin songs ever recorded by Etta James, Billie Holiday, Bill Evans, Stevie Wonder, Ray Charles, Nina Simone, Muddy Waters, Django Reinhardt, Louis Armstrong, Miles Davis, James Brown, Chet Baker, Frank Sinatra, Ella Fitzgerald, Harry Belafonte, Nat King Cole, Louis Prima, Duke Ellington, Elvis Presley, Count Basie, Little Walter, Herbie Hancock, Edith Piaf, Aretha Franklin, Charlie Parker, Lightnin' Hopkins, Son House, B.B.
