Nina Simone /ˈniːnə sɨˈmoʊn/ (born Eunice Kathleen Waymon; February 21, 1933 – April 21, 2003) was an American singer, songwriter, pianist, arranger, and civil rights activist widely associated with jazz music. She worked in a broad range of styles including classical, jazz, blues, folk, R&B, gospel, and pop.\n\nThe sixth child of a preacher's family in North Carolina, Simone aspired to be a concert pianist.[1] Her musical path changed direction after she was denied a scholarship to the prestigious Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, despite a well-received audition. Simone said she later found out from an insider at Curtis that she was denied entry because she was black.[2] So as to fund her continuing musical education and become a classical pianist, she began playing in a small club in Philadelphia where she was also required to sing. She was approached for a recording by Bethlehem Records, and her rendering of \"I Loves You, Porgy\" was a hit in the United States in 1958.[1] Over the length of her career Simone recorded more than 40 albums, mostly between 1958, when she made her debut with Little Girl Blue, and 1974.\n\nHer musical style arose from a fusion of gospel and pop songs with classical music, in particular with influences from her first inspiration, Johann Sebastian Bach,[3] and accompanied with her expressive jazz-like singing in her characteristic contralto voice. She injected as much of her classical background into her music as possible to give it more depth and quality, as she felt that pop music was inferior to classical.[4] Her intuitive grasp on the audience–performer relationship was gained from a unique background of playing piano accompaniment for church revivals and sermons regularly from the early age of six years old.[5]","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3ZS7iKdRo5Q/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3ZS7iKdRo5Q/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3ZS7iKdRo5Q/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360}},"channelTitle":"mavedro","liveBroadcastContent":"none"},{"id":"f4tTzan4dk4","publishedAt":"2012-03-17T08:16:01.000Z","channelId":"UCkzUtbU15lA7R4miFUtTq5g","title":"Seal - Stand By Me","description":"","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/f4tTzan4dk4/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/f4tTzan4dk4/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/f4tTzan4dk4/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360}},"channelTitle":"DarkyPhilou","liveBroadcastContent":"none"},{"id":"ABfQuZqq8wg","publishedAt":"2018-09-04T16:35:16.000Z","channelId":"UCpMMYJB5GJAYSJr3QpxnHEg","title":"Ain't No Mountain High Enough","description":"Provided to YouTube by Universal Music Group\n\nAin't No Mountain High Enough · Marvin Gaye · Tammi Terrell\n\nThe Complete Duets\n\n℗ 1967 Motown Records, a Division of UMG Recordings, Inc.\n\nReleased on: 2001-11-20\n\nComposer  Lyricist: Valerie Simpson\nComposer  Lyricist: Nickolas Ashford\n\nAuto-generated by YouTube.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ABfQuZqq8wg/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ABfQuZqq8wg/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ABfQuZqq8wg/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360}},"channelTitle":"Marvin Gaye - Topic","liveBroadcastContent":"none"},{"id":"HqYnevHibaI","publishedAt":"2011-04-05T23:34:23.000Z","channelId":"UC7TDZrm6vmMJ-Y1O-6n2E8g","title":"Aretha Franklin - Think (The Blues Brothers Version)","description":"The Queen of Soul performing Think.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HqYnevHibaI/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HqYnevHibaI/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HqYnevHibaI/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360}},"channelTitle":"davdavdee","liveBroadcastContent":"none"},{"id":"XKRI8CcpC9M","publishedAt":"2012-05-12T21:59:49.000Z","channelId":"UCgobRZZP4xdf0Q3NrY3GcIA","title":"Whitney Houston - performing  \"I Will Always Love You\" (HD) com legenda.","description":"\" Tenha o senhor Jesus Cristo como seu maior guarda-costas a partir de agora e encante aos anjos com sua voz ....eles também merecem ouvi-la\" .\r\nDescanse em Paz .\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\"Be the Lord Jesus Christ as his greatest bodyguards from now on and charm the angels with his voice .... they deserve to hear it.\"\r\n Rest in Peace.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XKRI8CcpC9M/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XKRI8CcpC9M/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XKRI8CcpC9M/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360}},"channelTitle":"GALANTE - JOC","liveBroadcastContent":"none"},{"id":"w3LZQLkGsSY","publishedAt":"2010-12-09T11:21:45.000Z","channelId":"UC_PytnuZXmV2RpQkKDw8hlQ","title":"Can't take my eyes off you (subtitulada)","description":"Versión del tema interpretada por el cantante de A-Ha.

Se fundó en la ciudad de su mismo nombre, en 1967, aunque inicialmente se denominó \"Chicago Transit Authority\", nombre que debieron recortar por problemas jurídicos con la autoridad de transporte público de la ciudad. El grupo permanece activo en la actualidad.La banda estuvo integrada, inicialmente, por Lee Loughnane (trompeta), James Pankow (trombón), Walter Parazaider (saxos, flauta), Robert Lamm (voz, piano, órgano), Terry Kath (guitarra, voz), Peter Cetera (bajo, voz) y Danny Seraphine (batería, percusión). Al contrario que BS&T, Chicago mantuvo esta formación bastante estable, a lo largo de su historia. El grupo se formó en el invierno de 1967, a partir del núcleo de la banda de Kath, Parazaider y Seraphine, que se llamaba \"The Missing Links\", durante una jam session en la Universidad DePaul, cuando se les unieron en el escenario Pankow y Loughnane. El nuevo grupo se llamó \"The Big Thing\",y se completó poco después con Cetera y Lam. Fue éste quien embarcó a la banda en una gira a Los Ángeles, donde, ya bajo el nombre de Chicago Transit Authority, cosecharon un inesperado éxito.\n\nEse mismo año, el productor James William Guercio, decidió tutelarlos y, por ello, renunció a producir el primer disco de BS&T, tal como le había pedido Al Kooper. Sí produjo, sin embargo, el segundo, aunque sólo después de que CBS le hubiese dado luz verde a la grabación del primer álbum de \"sus chicos\".GENEROS: Rock,Soft rock,Jazz rock,Jazz fusion,Pop rock,Rock progresivo.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/x90oqr7k9g0/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/x90oqr7k9g0/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/x90oqr7k9g0/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360}},"channelTitle":"Mily Diamante","liveBroadcastContent":"none"},{"id":"__VQX2Xn7tI","publishedAt":"2006-06-05T12:36:37.000Z","channelId":"UCN9Y_N7yRxFf6OSF9_KUzgQ","title":"carpenters -We've Only Just Begun","description":"MTV","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/__VQX2Xn7tI/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/__VQX2Xn7tI/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/__VQX2Xn7tI/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360}},"channelTitle":"ryanche33","liveBroadcastContent":"none"},{"id":"PSoOFn3wQV4","publishedAt":"2013-01-25T00:36:15.000Z","channelId":"UCzIOJfQMRe_-TlUOeVMqzzQ","title":"The Bangles - Eternal Flame (Official Video)","description":"Official Music Video for “Eternal Flame” by The Bangles\nListen to The Bangles: https://TheBangles.lnk.to/essentialYD\n\n'Eternal Flame' comes off The Bangles' third album, \"Everything\", released in 1988.

It's not the entire songs (which is very unfortunate but I wasn't very skilled back then) and the text is a brief overview of her life. I had just read a book about Janis which is why I added the comments between the pictures. I could relate so much to her inner demons and struggles at that time which is why I put my focus on that instead of the good things she achieved and how she changed the world. That's also unfortunate but that's how it is.\nThere are many more videos out there that contains more information if you want to read about Janis. I just made this video for fun, bored at work. Didn't realise it would be viewed 10 million times. So I apologise for the crappy quality and the abrupt end of the song. \nIf you still want to listen, be my guest! :)\n\nPs.

The music score was by Burt Bacharach with song lyrics by Hal David. Along with Newman and Redford, the film stars Katharine Ross as Etta Place, and features Strother Martin, Henry Jones, Jeff Corey, Sam Elliott, Cloris Leachman, Ted Cassidy, Kenneth Mars, and Donnelly Rhodes.\r\n\r\nButch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969) is the likeably entertaining, charming and amusing comedy/drama of the friendship and camaraderie shared between the two handsome and humorous buddy leads - legendary, turn-of-the-century Western outlaws and their \"Hole in the Wall\" gang. Historical antecedents for the two daring \"Robin Hood\" outlaws actually existed, two notorious figures who were sadly anachronistic for their turn-of-the-century times: \r\n\r\n•\"Butch Cassidy\"
