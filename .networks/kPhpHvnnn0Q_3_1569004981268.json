During his career, Vandross sold over twenty-five million albums and won eight Grammy Awards including Best Male R&B Vocal Performance four times. He won four Grammy Awards in 2004 including the Grammy Award for Song of the Year for the track \"Dance with My Father\", co-written with Richard Marx.\nVandross suffered from diabetes and hypertension, both of which ran in his family.\nOn April 16, 2003, Vandross suffered a stroke at his home in New York City. At the time of his stroke, he had just finished the final vocals for the album Dance With My Father. His collaborator on the album was pop star Richard Marx, whom Vandross had met in 1989. Vandross appeared briefly on videotape at the 2004 Grammy Awards to accept his Song of the Year Award, where he said, \"When I say goodbye it's never for long because I believe in the power of love\". Other than an appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show, he was never seen in public again.\nVandross died on July 1, 2005 at John F. Kennedy Medical Center in Edison, New Jersey at the age of 54. The apparent cause of his death was a heart attack.\nAfter two days of viewing at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel, his funeral was held at Riverside Church in New York City on July 8, 2005. Vandross was interred at George Washington Memorial Park in Paramus, New Jersey. Much of his estate was left to friends and his godson Mark West.\nFor additional text, please refer to;\nLuther Vandross\nat Wkipedia, the free encyclopedia","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WQDLu0tRASI/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WQDLu0tRASI/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WQDLu0tRASI/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360}},"channelTitle":"BERTOsCAFEdeMANNILE","liveBroadcastContent":"none"},{"id":"QShq1KGbEOk","publishedAt":"2019-08-31T16:06:03.000Z","channelId":"UCeqZi_19IJ0bNaGVugG7u7A","title":"Gryffin & Slander - All You Need To Know ft.

Lyrics","description":"NO COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT INTENDED, I DO NOT OWN THE SONG OR THE PICTURES!!\r\n\r\nThis song was released years ago, but it's lovely and I really like it!! :)\r\n\r\nLyrics:\r\nSometimes late at night\r\nI lie awake and watch her sleeping\r\nShe's lost in peaceful dreams\r\nSo I turn out the light\r\nLay there in the dark\r\nAnd the thought crosses my mind\r\nIf I never wake in the morning\r\nWould she ever doubt the way I feel\r\nAbout her in my heart?\r\n\r\nIf tomorrow never comes\r\nWill she know how much I loved her?\r\nDid I try in every way\r\nTo show her every day\r\nThat she's my only one?\r\nAnd if my time on Earth were through\r\nShe must face this world without me\r\nIs the love I gave her in the past\r\nGonna be enough to last\r\nIf tomorrow never comes?\r\n\r\n'Cause I've lost loved ones in my life\r\nWho never knew how much I loved them\r\nNow I live with the regret\r\nThat my true feelings for them\r\nNever were revealed\r\nSo I made a promise to myself\r\nTo say each day how much she means to me\r\nAnd avoid that circumstance\r\nWhere there's no second chance\r\nTo tell her how I feel\r\n\r\nIf tomorrow never comes\r\nWill she know how much I loved her?\r\nDid I try in every way\r\nTo show her every day\r\nThat she's my only one?\r\nAnd if my time on Earth were through\r\nShe must face this world without me\r\nIs the love I gave her in the past\r\nGonna be enough to last\r\nIf tomorrow never comes?\r\n\r\nTo tell that someone that you love\r\nJust what you're thinking of\r\nIf tomorrow never
